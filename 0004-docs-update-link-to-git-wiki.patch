Subject: [PATCH 004/834] docs: update link to git-wiki
MIME-Version: 1.0
Content-Type: text/plain; charset=UTF-8
Content-Transfer-Encoding: 8bit

The Git Wiki has been long deprecated, and is now partially removed. The
article we pointed to here seems to not have been backed up.

However, there's a new place that documents installing on Windows in the
Git Docs instead. So let's send users there instead.
