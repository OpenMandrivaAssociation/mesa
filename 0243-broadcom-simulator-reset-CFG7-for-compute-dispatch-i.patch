Subject: [PATCH 243/834] broadcom/simulator: reset CFG7 for compute dispatch
 in v71
MIME-Version: 1.0
Content-Type: text/plain; charset=UTF-8
Content-Transfer-Encoding: 8bit

This register is new in 7.x, it doesn't seem that we need to
do anything specific for now, but let's make sure it is reset
every time.
